# CI pyISSM / ISSM tests

This directory is intended to house CI-specific tests.

Tests contained here follow the same naming/numbering convention as (and are equivalent to) [NightlyRun tests](https://github.com/ISSMteam/ISSM/tree/main/test/NightlyRun) contained in the [ISSM Github Repository](https://github.com/ISSMteam/ISSM/). pyISSM CI tests use [Archive files from the ISSM Github Repository](https://github.com/ISSMteam/ISSM/tree/main/test/Archives) to ensure comparable results are achieved using pyISSM.
